# Purpose

This repository will be containing the source code for my personal project which is to create a web application similar to facebook. This project will allow me to get a hands on experience in full stack development which will require me to use javascript and various frameworks such as Express.js, React and Node.js, and creating a database to store my web app information which is MongoDB

## Imports
Being that this will be an individual full stack development for a web application, there will be a need for various imports of packages and modules which will assist me in this personal project.

*Definition of Middleware: a software component or function that sits between the client and server and helps handle requests and responses. It is a way to extend the functionality of a web application by performing various tasks during the processing of HTTP requests.*

* **Mongoose** to access my database in mongoDB.
* **Express** from Node.js to be able to establish routing, middleware, templating, error handling, static file serving, and application configuration.
* **Body Parser** from Node.js to extract the body of incoming HTTP requests.
* **CORS** (Cross-origin resource sharing)which will allow servers to specify which domain are permitted to access specific resources and protects against cross-origin attacks. CORS is a package/module that will be imported into the Node.js project.
* **Multer** is a middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is used for uploading files in web applications. Multer is used with Node.js and Express web framework.
* **Dotenv** is a npm package to help manage configuration or environment variables in Node.js applications. It used to store information such as API keys, database credentials, or anything sensitive that needs to be used by the application.
* **Helmet** is a npm package to secure Express.js applications by setting various HTTP headers related to security. Easy way to enhance the security of a web app by adding a set of recommended security headers.
* **Morgan** is a npm package that provides middleware for logging HTTP requests in Node.js applications. Morgan stores detailed information about the incoming requests and outputs it to the console or a log file which allows to monitor and analyze the traffic and behavior of the web app.
* **Path** is a built-in module in NOde.js that provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
